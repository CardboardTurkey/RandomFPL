# RandomFPL
As everybody around me only talks about PL and FPL I decide to join with a random generated team.
This code uses the [FPL API](https://fpl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  to generate a team removing all the players who are injured or suspended and mazimising the total amount of money spent.

To run
`python fantasy_random.py`
